# kmn-graph-visualizer

This project visualizes the \( K_{m,n} \) graph game, providing both graph and matrix representations with interactive features for toggling connections.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Visualize the \( K_{m,n} \) graph using D3.js, allowing users to interactively toggle connections between nodes.
- **Matrix Representation**: Display the adjacency matrix of the graph, where users can click on cells to toggle connections.
- **Dynamic Controls**: Input fields to set the values of \( m \) and \( n \), updating the visualizations in real-time.

## Getting Started
